     </ul>

     <h2><u>Preparation</u></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Beat the butter and brown sugar in another large bowl with an electronic mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.(Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or preferably overnight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees farenheit. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a 1 ounce ice cream scoop to scoop half the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Chill the remaining dough while you bake the first batch.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the middle for 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely, then line with parchment paper again if necessary and repeat thw scooping and baking process with the remaining dough.</li>
